# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:05-03-25
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6. End 
## Program:
```

/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  for (i =0; i < size; i++)
    printf("%d ",array[i]);
}

```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
